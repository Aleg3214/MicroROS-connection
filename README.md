I installed and setup MicroROS connection between boards from STM32's family.
I tried to execute the communication firstly on the board NUCLEO STM32U575ZI-T without success.
I then tried and managed to execute the communication on NUCLEO STM32F401RET6.
I documented my experience, problems and solutions found on the following document:
[Embedded_Systems.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17296694/Embedded_Systems.pdf)

The document can be taken as a tutorial on how to launch the communication and how to debug certain errors that can occurr.

NOTE
I documented my way trough all the attempts but I committed only the functioning code which belongs to the STM32F401RET6's project.
